        When I was in college, a friend of mine was in our school's gamelan
        ensemble. While looking up videos of gamelan music to explain to me what
        a gamelan, she encountered one titled "Gamelan Legacy." At the time, I
        commented that it sounded like a video game. Three years later, I solo
        developed this basic platformer game about wearing gamelans for armor
        and creating music when you jump and run into your enemies.
